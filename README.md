# ASA-Website
A Website I built for Vassar's Asian Students' Alliance

This was a project that I started while I was treasurer for ASA my sophomore year (2018 - 2019). I started working on it winter break (January 2019). 

The purpose of it was to just promote our club and also serve as a place for history/documentation. A mostly working build was finished, but the website was never launched as I got busy with classes and Vassar administration gave me a run around in terms of being able to host this website. By the time I realized I would have to host it on my own, the school year was wrapping up and it wasn't worth it anymore to spend the money to launch the website. There were still more things I was hoping to add and a few details to finish up, but overall I learned a lot about HTML/CSS and making mobile-friendly websites.

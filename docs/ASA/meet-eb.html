        HI ASA, I LOVE YOU. My name is Heather Phan Nguyen. I was born in Seattle, my family resides in Utah, and I currently live in the moment. Ha. I'm president for the 2018-2019 school year, after two years as Media Chair - if the past three years on ASA have taught me anything, it's that the love of a community can move space and time. I'm eternally grateful for the people I've met and lessons I've learned here at Vassar, and my goal is to uplift underrepresented communities and work towards expanding the narrative of what it means to be Asian/Asian American. I'm a first-gen low-income Vietnamese American with a penchant for blowing all my money on boba. Talk to me about Media Studies, being a Leo, bullet journaling, or

        I also like long walks on the beach and

        Hey folks!
        I'm Tammy. I am a second-year Taiwanese pal from Flushing, New York that loves eating dorayaki, Japanese sweet potatoes (yakiimo), and oyster omelets. When the weather gets super freezing during the winter, I love warming my hands with baked sweet potatoes and seeing steamy twirls out of the soft, yellow flesh that tastes like heaven! I'm currently a Neuroscience and Behavior major and on the pre-health track. When I'm not studying in the library basement, I try acting like I know how to play the ukelele, painting my woes away, and singing the songs of Daniel Caesar, Jay Chou, and Jonghyun. If you ever want to try 99% dark chocolate, I'm the girl you want to hit up. The ASA community has gifted me the chance to learn about the big hearts and life stories of others, and I have been extremely grateful to have a space where I can embrace the colorful identities that exist today. Do feel free to reach out when you're seeking for meaningful and self-reflective conversations--whether you want to vent out that stress, show me your passions, talk about your family's ancestry, or even give me a hand hug, I'm ready.

        Hello! My name is Tamika and I am from El Cerrito, California (near Berkeley in the SF Bay Area….I love California and the Bay Area and will talk about it forever hehe). I’m an Environmental Studies major and also thinking about an Education correlate. I’m particularly interested in food systems! I love to cook, bake, and eat, and I’m also interested in farming and growing food. I’m especially fond of vegetables and dark chocolate (but not together). I really like exercise, especially running! Nature makes me smile, and I love hiking, camping, stargazing :) My Asian American background and family is important to me and I’m excited to work with ASA this year to build community and explore our identities as Asian students at Vassar.

        what’s good. i’m johnson lin and i will be your treasurer for this upcoming year! i’m from edison, nj. i am going to be a math major. i will probably double major in either chinese or japanese. if the stars align, i could end up triple majoring despite all of the people in my life telling me it’s not a good idea (though they’re probably right). i listen to all kinds of music. growing up, my favorite band was linkin park. i’ve never fully grown out of my emo phase (i still love post hardcore and pop punk). i listen to a lot of r&b and some hip hop. some of my favorite songs right now are i like u by niki, gelato by tyler the creator, and text me by dpr live. my biggest hobby is fashion. my favorite designers of all time are yohji yamamoto and raf simons. but make no mistake, i am rather poor and can’t actually afford these designer clothes. one of my favorite pastimes is walking around soho looking at clothes that are triple my net worth. if y’all ever need any tips or want me to alert you on any sales (i sale hunt like crazy) feel free to let me know! i would be more than happy to help you (and that goes for anything, fashion or not)!

        Hi anyone reading this. I’m your administrative liaison this year, Spencer D McGrath. I hail from the LGBTQ+ city Northampton, Massachusetts. I’m a Chinese adoptee with two fathers (they are very gay and married to each other). Somehow I made it to sophomore year, and am now planning to be a Psychology-Chinese double major on premed track. I’m the 1West student fellow in Cushing! I like people, reading, music, dancing, sports, over committing myself. If you’re interested in joining ultimate frisbee or KoDC that’s where you’ll find me when I’m not doing ASA or ignoring homework. I also worked in the LGBTQ+ Center last year so if you have questions regarding LGBTQ+ stuff come ask! Feel free to say hi when you see me or come find me to have conversations varying from serious to completely random. Looking forward to being with all you wonderful people this year!

        Hi everyone! My name is Alex and I am an international student from Seoul, South Korea. I
        am a sophomore planning to double major in Education and Psychology or Media studies
        and minor in Chinese (I AM A VERY INDECISIVE PERSON WITH A WIDE RANGE OF
        INTERESTS!) I love to sing, write on my blog, and explore different parts of the world
        (especially nature) to take aesthetic pictures!!! If you come to me and talk about Mamma
        Mia, RENT, or La la land, you will definitely get a free hug from me ;) You can find me in
        Main or the library lawn (when it’s nice outside). I am so excited to work as a committee
        chair this year and cannot wait to get to know you all! If you have questions about
        anything, hit me up via email or facebook messenger!

        Hello! My name is Gabor Fu Ptacek and I’m one of the co-first year representatives for ASA. I identify as Taiwanese American and biracial and I’m from San Francisco (please talk to me about Taiwan and/or SF if you're willing to hear me rant)! I’m a computer science major hopefully with correlates in Asian Studies and Chinese. Some of my hobbies/interests include fashion, board games, calligraphy, and tennis! I also love Studio Ghibli movies, Asian and Asian American rap, and reading (whenever I can find time). I’m excited for this second semester and all the events we have planned. Never hesitate to say hi! Hope to see you around!

        Hi I’m Sandra, one of your two first year representatives! I’m a prospective biochem major and I’m from New York City! I really like corgis (there’s a small stuffed one in my room since my parents never let me have one), bubble tea, two hour midday naps, and last but not least, literally everyone in ASA! No matter where I am, please come to say hi and we can talk about food, naps, and maybe how cool it is to be Asian! Thank you for having me as your first year rep! 😊

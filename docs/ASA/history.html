    ASA has been an org at Vassar since the 1980s. Unfortunately, most of the history documented is in paper form, stuffed in dusty cabinets in our closet. We do have an older website that has been around since 2006 (at least, that's the oldest dated post on the website). You can check out blurbs from previous EBs and some photos from before 2013! We have minutes posted and also blog posts that date all the way back to August 30, 2006. Feel free to give it a look:

    Our amazing ASC Chair, Alex Kim, also has cool article about the history of ASA and interviewed some alumni about it that is coming out along with the magazine ASC has been working hard on. Keep an eye out for when that is released!

        ASA does two major events every year: Night Market and Lunar New Year! Learn more about them, and other events we have planned this year, here:
    </p>
</div>
<div id="night-market">
    <h2>Night Market</h2>
    <p>
        Night Market happens every year during the fall semester, usually around early November. ASA collabs with a bunch of other orgs to sell food in the College Center, and people stroll through and buy food, imitating a real Night Market. It's an event paying homage to the atmosphere of night markets popular in places like Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the United States. The event is geared toward showcasing, celebrating, and sampling the range of foods, desserts, snacks, and drinks that the members of our culturally diverse community here at Vassar love and adore!

    <h2>Lunar New Year</h2>
    <p>
        Lunar New Year happens every year during the spring semester; we make it as close to the actual date of Lunar New Year as possible so it's usually early February as late January can sometimes be impossible. Lunar New Year almost always falls under the spring semester so those of us who would typically celebrate it with family are usually not home to do so. Thus, this event was created. But this isn't just a celebration, but also a promotion of culture! Despite being typically called Chinese New Year's, we try to incorporate aspects from all countries that celebrate Lunar New Year. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Lunar New Year will be on February 9, 2019 in the AULA from 6-8pm this year! Tabling begins soon so keep your eye out for us in the college center to grab tickets. Hope to see you there!

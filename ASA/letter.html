<h1>A Letter From Our Treasurer</h1>
<body>
    hi friends! :)
</body>
<br>
<br>
<body>
    i'm johnson lin, asa's treasurer this year. i just wanted to write a little letter to y'all reading this since i'm the one who built this website from scratch! i don't really code so the website might be a little broken and a little ugly so if y'all have any bugs/criticisms for me, definitely reach out on facebook or email! 
</body>
<br>
<br>
<body>
    i think the slight ugliness is a little endearing, but that might be just because this is something i made. regardless, asa has been a big part of my life here at vassar. i've met some amazing people through this org and it has really made me feel at home. i don't think i'm as comfortable anywhere else on campus except maybe my room. and so in a way, this is part of my giving back to the org. making this website has been an interesting learning experience, but more importantly this website hopefully help shows why i'm so in love with this org and its people.
</body>
<br>
<br>
<body>
    i hope through this website you guys get to meet all of us on board (very lovely people, i promise) and learn about our events. we work hard to build a community for asian identifying students and it's been so heartwarming to watch it pay off. and i hope that you guys can get a taste of that community on here and want to join. because i know i, for one, want you to join. so i hope to see your beautiful faces at our gb meetings. or for those of you can't, i hope that we have at least left you with inspiration or ideas and maybe you'll even reach out for potential collaboration!

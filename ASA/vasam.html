<h1>Vassar's Asian American Studies Working Group (VASAM)</h1>
</div>
</div>
<div id="body">
<p>
    The Asian American Studies Working Group is a coalition of students working towards the establishment of a substantive Asian American Studies program that is part of the larger field of ethnic studies. We seek to remember the roots of Asian American Studies as stemming from the Third World Liberation Front’s movement and to build on the work of past Vassar student activists who have been pushing for the introduction of an Asian American Studies program since 1979. As of 2019, Vassar College has an Asian American Studies correlate sequence, but still lacks professors and courses specifically dedicated the discipline. In the past year, our working group has advocated for Asian American Studies through visual media and social media campaigns, tabling events, workshops led by prominent scholars, and numerous meetings with the college administration.
</p>
<br>
<p id="meeting">
    We meet every Friday from 6pm - 7pm in the Raymond MPR. Come through and learn about what we do!

<h1>Gary Okihiro Comes to Vassar</h1>
<p>
    Gary Y. Okihiro is a visiting professor of American studies at Yale University and professor emeritus at Columbia University where he was a professor of international and public affairs and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race. He is the author of twelve books, including Third World Studies: Theorizing Liberation (2016), and American History Unbound: Asians and Pacific Islanders (2015). He is the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Studies Association and the Association for Asian American Studies, received an honorary doctorate from the University of the Ryukyus, and is a past president of the Association for Asian American Studies.  
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Professor Okihiro gave a workshop titled "Asian American Studies: How It Changes Our Views of U.S. History and Society" and a lecture titled "Third World Studies and World History: A Conversation." Okihiro emphasized a discussion based lecture as he urged students to ask him questions rather than giving a presentation. He shared a lot of insightful thoughts and we loved having him here!

    <h1>Big Sib, Little Sib Program</h1>  
</div>
<div id="flex-container2">
<div id="bsls-text">
    <p id="intro">
        The Big Sib Little Sib Program (BSLS) is a mentorship program sponsored by ASA. We have implemented the program in order to foster a community between underclassmen and upperclassmen to allow an easier transition in college life for freshman who identify, in some way, as Asian.
    </p>
    <h2>Making a Connection</h2>
    <p>
        At ASA’s Annual Picnic at the beginning of the school year, big siblings and little siblings who have been matched during the summer have a chance to meet each other for the first time and get to know each other. From then on, it’s up to those upperclassmen to remain proactive about helping their little siblings get adjusted and stay adjusted to life on campus. With that in consideration, seeing as how the program was created to help first-year students transition smoothly into colleges, we are adults. At some point, first-year students may not need as much guidance and help as they may at the beginning of the year. At these points of stability, simple outreach and checking in is enough to maintain the connection and relationship we have as members of the Asian community. ASA and ALANA orgs are nonetheless always available and our resources are available to any little sibling at any point of the year.
    </p>
    <h2>Regular Programming</h2>
    <p>
        The BSLS program entails social commitment. From attending BSLS events together, or catching up over dinner at the deece, ASA will be sure to host events and discussions that will help big siblings and little siblings to bond throughout the year. In the past, we have done movie nights, game nights, and a bowling night! We plan to host more discussions and meetings to make the program not just recreational, but also conducive to personal and interpersonal growth.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Get Involved</h2>
    <p>
        For more information, contact Spencer D. McGrath, ASA’s Administrative Liaison for the 2018 – 2019 school year. To be a big sibling or a little sibling, look out for an email sent out in the middle of summer! If you have not received that email and would still like to participate, contact Spencer at smcgrath@vassar.edu. For any other concerns and questions concerning BSLS, those questions should be directed towards him as well.

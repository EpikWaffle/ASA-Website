<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
<p>
    The primary goal of the Asian Students’ Alliance (ASA) is to develop a strong sense of identity and to educate the larger community about the issues concerning Asians and Asian Americans. ASA will provide support to its members and serve as a body to represent, to the best of its ability, the distinct cultures of all of the members of ASA. ASA’s support extends to the community of color at large, as well as other social awareness groups.

<h3>Section I. Statement of Purpose</h3>
<a class="top-link" href="#top">Back to top</a>
<br>
<p>The creed that all people are created equal is a fundamental pillar of the United States of America. While this foundation rests on a principle of equality, the Asian Students’ Alliance of Vassar College recognizes that it is an ideal that does not exist within the frames of this society. With this in mind, the Asian Students’ Alliance wishes to establish an organization of social, cultural, and political awareness at Vassar College. Our goal is twofold. First, we will strive to overcome and eradicate existing racial inequities of this society. Second, we will serve as a resource for Vassar, as well as the greater public on Asian and Asian American culture and situations within the borders of the United States and overseas. To this end, ASA will satisfy the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ASA will promote and represent the distinct cultures of Asia to the best of its ability.</li>
    <li>ASA will program and hold events that further advance cultural, social, political, and historical awareness.</li>
    <li>ASA will support and encourage coalition building between ASA and other student organizations on campus.</li>
    <li>ASA will consist of an Executive Board that will carry out the terms in this Constitution.</li>
    <li>ASA will keep records of activities for ASA’s archives.</li>
</ul>

<div id="part4">
<h3>Section IV. Nominations and Elections</h3>
<a class="top-link" href="#top">Back to top</a>
<br>
<p>The ASA Executive Board will be newly elected every spring by the end of classes in May at the latest. To oversee the elections processes, an Elections Committee, composed of only seniors, will be created for each election at least a week prior to Election Day.</p>
<ol type=A>
    <li>Elections Committee</li>
        <ol>
            <li>The Elections Committee will be responsible for overseeing Election Day which includes, but is not limited to, distributing, collecting, and counting the votes at the election.</li>
            <li>The Elections Committee will be responsible for counting how many total voters are present in the room throughout the elections. These numbers will be counted at the beginning of elections and after each round of speeches, i.e. a round of speeches is all the candidates for one position.</li>
            <li>Those eligible to serve on Elections Committee will be notified by email or in person and asked to serve on Elections Committee.</li>
            <li>The Elections Committee will be comprised of at least three seniors who satisfy all of the following conditions:
                <ul>
                    <li>The senior may not be an active Executive Board member.</li>
                    <li>The senior must be on the current ASA mailing list and have been active in ASA in the past as a General Body and/or Executive Board member.</li>
                    <li>The senior must volunteer to serve.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Those on the Elections Committee may not vote during the elections.</li>
            <li>The Elections Committee will submit all votes to the residing Executive Board after the elections for ASA records.</li>
        </ol>
    <li>Nominations Process and Eligibility
        <ol>
            <li>Nominations shall be submitted to the Executive Board prior to the elections.</li>
            <li>Students may be self-nominated or nominated by other students. Once nominated, they must choose to run for only one position.</li>
            <li>Candidates must be currently matriculated students at Vassar College.</li>
            <li>Candidates must have attended at least four General Body and/or ASC meetings during the current academic school year.</li>
            <li>Voters must be currently matriculated students at Vassar College.</li>
            <li>Voters must have attended at least two General Body and/or ASC meetings during their entire college career.
                <ul>
                    <li>This was edited on April 10, 2016. Executive Board 2015-2016 believe that in the interest of API students who may feel that they have been underrepresented by any past or current body of ASA, and thus, have chosen to not attend, changed the requirement for voting in ASA elections from having to have attended at least two ASA meetings  during “the current academic school year” to in “their entire college career.” This amendment invites students to vote for candidates whose visions they most align with, in the hopes of a more representative Executive Board.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Current Executive Board members may not officially advocate a nominee.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Voting Process
        <ol>
            <li>Candidates
                <ul>
                    <li>Each candidate must prepare a speech to be presented at the election.</li>
                    <li>In the event that a candidate cannot make it to the election, he/she/they must request permission from the Executive Board for a proxy. Upon approval, the candidate must provide his/her/their own proxy.</li>
                    <li>Each speech will be followed by a question and answer session that will last at the discretion of the Elections Committee.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Tallying Votes
                <ul>
                    <li>When tallying the votes, all abstentions shall be disregarded. Abstentions, however, will count towards the total number of votes submitted.</li>
                    <li>A candidate must have more than 50% of the votes in order to win. If there is more than one candidate for an office, and no candidate has more than 50% of the votes, the Elections Committee will hold an instant run-off between the two candidates with the most votes. Voters must vote again between the two candidates at that time.*</li>
                    <li>In the event that a candidate is running unopposed, he/she/they must have two-thirds or more of the votes to win.</li>
                    <li>In the event of a tie, the Executive Board will break the tie. If an active Executive Member is running for the office that is tied, he/she/they must abstain from voting in the tie.</li>
                    <li>Votes may be valid if submitted for each position separately as long as the voter was present for all the candidates’ speeches for those positions. If submitted prior to the completion of all the speeches for a position, the voter’s vote for that position and thereafter will be invalid.**</li>
                    <li>Ballots must be completely filled out in order to be valid.</li>
                    <li>Voting by proxy is not permitted.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Unfilled positions
                <ul>
                    <li>In the event that an office is left unoccupied, the residing Executive Board maintains the right to fill the office as it so chooses.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                In the ASA Elections of 2015 to decide the Executive Board for the year 2015-16, the position of secretary had two candidates running, neither of whom received more than 50% of the total number of votes. According to the Constitution, neither candidate was eligible to win the position and therefore, it was left unfilled. The residing Executive Board, on the recommendation of the Elections Committee and the seniors’ prior experience with a similar situation in 2012, decided to fill the position by closed appointment. The Executive Board members each nominated a candidate they felt would benefit ASA as an organization for the position, one of which ran in the elections and the other was another GB member. The two candidates were sent the same interview-type questions via email and given a deadline to respond. One Executive Board member chose to not vote and was put in charge of this process. The responses were received and anonymously reviewed by each Executive Board member and votes were cast. The secretary position was thus filled through this process. The residing Executive Board of 2014-15 ran into a lot of difficulties with a vague founding Constitution and realized that this situation should be left in ASA records for future Executive Boards.
                <ul>
                    <li>This was edited 4/29/15. This originally said “Votes submitted prior to the completion of all the candidates’ speeches will be invalid.” Reason for revising: Many GB members cannot stay for the entire elections (often 2+ hours long) because of conflicts they cannot get out of, but they are still eligible to vote. Since they are active members of ASA, the Executive Board thought that they should still have a say in who comprises the Executive Board. This edit was how we thought it would be most fair for them to still vote but we chose to not advertise this fact to all of GB (only those who had expressed a prior time conflict) in case some took advantage of it.</li>
